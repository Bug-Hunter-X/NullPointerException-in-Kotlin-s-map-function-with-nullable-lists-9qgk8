This repository demonstrates a potential NullPointerException in Kotlin when using the `map` function with nullable lists. The `BuggyMap.kt` file shows the problematic code, while `FixedMap.kt` provides a solution using the safe call operator and elvis operator.  The issue arises when the list is null; the `map` function will throw an exception.  The solution handles the null case gracefully.
